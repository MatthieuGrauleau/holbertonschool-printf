# C - Printf Projet

## Description

The objective of this project is to create our own printf function in the C language. The printf function is commonly used to display formatted text during program execution. The goal of this project is to delve into the mechanics of the standard printf function in the C library and gain a deeper understanding of its functionality.

## Compilation

To compile your code, you should use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```


## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the specified options.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoid using global variables.
- Limit the number of functions per file to no more than 5.
- The prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named main.h.
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file and make sure it's include guarded.
- Do not provide the _putchar function for this project.
- There should be one project repository per group. Cloning, forking, or duplicating a project repository with the same name before the deadline risks a 0% score.

- Authorized functions and macros:
write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

## Mandatory Task

- Task 0
Write a function that produces output according to a format and the following conversion specifiers c, s, and %.
- Task 1
Handle the following conversion specifiers d, i.
- Task 2
Create a man page for your function.

## Examples
### Character
```
#include "main.h"
_printf("%c", 'H');
```
#### Output
```
"H"
```
### String
```
#include "main.h"
_printf("%s", "I am a string !");
```
#### Output
```
"I am a string !"
```
### Decimal and integer
```
#include "main.h"
int len = 1;
_printf("Length:%d, %i\n", len, len);
```
#### Output
```
"Length:1, 1"
```
