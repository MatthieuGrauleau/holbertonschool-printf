.SH SYNOPSIS

int _printf(const char *format,...)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function is a custom implementation of the printf() function in C, which formats and prints data to stdout according 

to the format specifier format. The format specifier is a character string containing conversion specifications,

 each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced
 
by the character '%', followed by a conversion specifier character. 

Supported conversion specifiers in this implementation are

'c' (character), 's' (string), '%' (percentage), 'd' (decimal), and 'i' (integer).

.SH RETURN
Upon successful completion, the _printf() function returns the number of characters printed 
(excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an error occurs, it returns -1.

.SH c
The format specifier is %c and this is used to print a single  character.

.SH s
The format specifier is %s and this is used to print a string.

.SH %
The format specifier is %% and this is used to print a percent.

.SH d
The format specifier is %d and this is used to print a decimal.

.SH i 
The format specifier is %i and this is used to print a integer.
